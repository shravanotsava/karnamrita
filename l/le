Carana Kamal
Author: Sūra Dasa
(refrain)
carana kamal vandoń hari rāyī
(1)
jālkī kṛpā pāńgu giri lāńge āndhe koń saba kachu darasāyī (2)
bahira sunni muka puni bolai rańka cale sira chatra dhāraye (3)
surdās swāmī karunāmaye bāra bāra vandoń tehi pāye
TRANSLATION
Refrain: I offer prayers unto the lotus feet of the worshipful Lord Hari.
1-2) By His mercy, a lame person crosses mountains, a blind person sees everything, a deaf person hears, a dumb person again speaks, and even a poor person walks with a servant holding an umbrella over his head.
3) The Lord of Sūra Dās is full of compassion. Therefore, I offer my obeisances unto His lotus feet, again and again.
